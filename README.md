# ðŸ§ªFront-End Engineering

This exercise is designed to assess your front-end engineering depth, architectural judgment, and coding quality. Please treat it as a production-grade implementation and demonstrate your approach to clean, scalable front-end applications.

## ðŸš€ The Task

Youâ€™ve been asked to build the **front-end** for a task management application used by a busy investment firm. The UI must be modern, modular, and intuitive.

---

## ðŸ”§ Requirements

### Core Features

- Build a front-end interface to manage tasks:
  - Create, edit, delete, and view tasks
  - Each task should include:
    - Title
    - Description
    - Due Date
    - Priority
    - Status (pending / in progress / completed)

- Filtering and sorting by:
  - Status
  - Priority
  - Due Date

---

### Technical Expectations

- Use **React** with a framework of your choice
- Architect the app for **scalability and modularity**
- Create a shareable component library
- Document your components in Storybook
- Apply modern **state management** techniques (e.g., Context, Zustand, Redux)
- Ensure **accessibility**, **responsiveness**, and **performance**
- Include **unit tests** and E2E tests

---

## ðŸ“˜ API Specification

This project uses an OpenAPI 3.0 specification to define the task API contract. Found [here](./task-api-spec.yaml).

## ðŸ’¡ Optional Bonus Points

- Add **CI/CD pipeline stubs** (e.g., GitHub Actions for linting/testing).
- Support **Dark Mode** or other accessibility modes.
- Add **UX polish** via animations or transitions.
- Show **micro-frontend readiness** or share any thoughts on modular front-end strategy.
- Deploy your solution
